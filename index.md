I want this to be the place where people go to learn about progressive enhancement. For now categories are articles, examples, tools, and guidelines, but this could change. After [#enhanceconf](https://twitter.com/hashtag/EnhanceConf?src=hash&lang=es) I will process the data, and PRs sent categorise it and redesign the site (this is just a placeholder).

If you want to contribute, this site is built on Jekyll and it's all available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jaicab/progressiveenhancement), so feel free to open an issue, make a PR or tweet me at [@jaicab_](https://twitter.com/jaicab_).
