# Progressive Enhancement.
A site for all things progressively enhanced. - [https://progressiveenhancement.org](https://progressiveenhancement.org)

If you have any resources that you have found insteresting related with **progressive enhancement**, please [submit them using this form](http://goo.gl/forms/X5fy7xpA0a), which can also be found embedded on the site.

I want this to be the place where people go to learn about progressive enhancement. For now categories are articles, examples, tools, and guidelines, but this could change. After [#enhanceconf](https://twitter.com/hashtag/EnhanceConf?src=hash&lang=es) I will process the data, and PRs sent categorise it and redesign the site (this is just a placeholder).

You can also create new files as PRs on GitHub and therefore get proper credit for your help. This is the pattern for a single resource.
